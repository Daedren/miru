# Miru
Miru is a simple anime torrent streaming client targetted at normies, meant as a replacement for shitty streaming sites with a lot of extra added functionality.
# Functionality, performance and compatibility
This site already does a lot, it's essentially a torrent client, streaming client, media player, anime list explorer and a bunch more, which is why performance might not be fantastic on lower end devices, it also uses a lot of flashy new technologies and hacky workarounds to do things you're not really meant to ever be doing which is why compatibility across browsers isn't flawless, I recommend using anything chromium based, and optionally enabling some experimental flags for extra functionality, performance and compatibility like:
- chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features : Enabled [This allows to play multi-audio files and adds more codec and container support, but it's not recommended]
# Features
I want anything and everything a **__STREAMING__** app should have, without any major compromises meaning that most features that aren't useful for watching anime won't be added [mainly list managment, community posts etc]
# Why?
Originally it was an inside joke among my friends, complaining about how shit streaming sites are and that I could make something better.
# Codebase
Let's face it, it's shit, it was never meant to actually work, and it outgrew me. Feel free to change it.
# Why did you do X in X way?
Either it was the only solution, I couldn't think of anything better, I didin't know it can be made better or I flat out just don't remember.
