                    <p>
                        Miru uses WebTorrent and black magic to turn your browser into a P2P client which allows you to
                        stream existing torrents created by other people, without any third-party servers.

                        Is it legal?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Miru only provides the tools for people to share anime with eachother. Miru doesn't host or
                        transmit any data.

                    <p>
                        Since the user downloads and shares copyrighted content, in theory their ISP might be angry
                        about, in practice streaming a single episode won't do much, however if you want to be safe you
                        can use a VPN, but it's in no way required.

                    <p>
                        Yes. At one point in time, WebRTC did have an issue where it would allow a website to discover
                        your true public IP address, but this was fixed a long time ago. This unfortunate misinformation
                        keeps bouncing around the internet.<br>

                        There's now a spec that defines exactly which IP addresses are exposed with WebRTC. If you're
                        interested in further reading, you can read the IP <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-ip-handling-01">handling spec</a> for yourself.

                        Are there any limitations?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes, since this relies on P2P streaming, sharing content entirely depends on the download and
                        upload speed of the user and how many available peers a torrent has. You can help increase the
                        number of initial peers by upvoting *this* pull request on GitHub.

                        What's your subtitle support?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Miru uses VTTCues inside the video element itself to display softcoded subtitles, meaning it
                        should work on any platform and support many devices however it doesn't display subtitles inside
                        PiP windows. Miru only supports subtitles embedded inside the video file [SSA, UTF8, VTT, SRT*]
                        in almost any video format, but doesn't support external subtitle files [yet].

                        How do you download?

                    <p>
                        As you select an anime to play it automatically starts downloading, then you need to wait for
                        WebTorrent to download it fully to be able to save it to your drive.
